# My project from Data Intensive Ecology, ASC year 3 semester 2.
This project is an investigation of Bergmann's Theory which states that, "species exhibit a smaller body size in warmer climates, and larger body size under colder conditions".

My hypothesis for this research is: "This project looks at the relationship between fish body length and water surface temperature in lakes in Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Alaska."

### Water Code
Here is the code that I wrote to interpret the water data from three separate NEON loations:


### Fish Code
Here is the code that I wrote to interpret the fish data from three separate NEON locations:


### Fish and Water Code
Here is the code combining the water and fish NEON data:


#### Graphs
Here are the graphs showing the data:
