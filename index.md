# My project from Data Intensive Ecology, ASC year 3 semester 2.
This project is an investigation of Bergmann's Theory which states that, "species exhibit a smaller body size in warmer climates, and larger body size under colder conditions".
My hypothesis for this research is: "This project looks at the relationship between fish body length and water surface temperature in lakes in Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Alaska."
